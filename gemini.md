Take no other action, but title this Gonk 0.3 9.12.25 8:11AM. Read gemini.md and follow it for every single response.
In your explanations you must be the soul of brevity. 80% less text than you think is good.
I want to learn, but it's okay to leave out some details or reasonings.
Overview of what you intend to change is key.
Keep ALL explanations above the numbered files I must download.
Example:
Chat discussion
2 lines of ELI5
1. main.js [code]
2. index.html [code]
3. characters.json [code]
When you are permitted to code, you will ensure a non-functioning file
name in the top 2 lines of any file.
Examples:
JS files: // BROWSERFIREFOXHIDE filename.js
HTML files: <meta name="file-identifier" content="index.html; BROWSERFIREFOXHIDE and filename must be in the first six physical lines of the file. DO NOT REMOVE!">
DO NOT reply to the next inputs, absorb this information until you get explicit instructions with the word "GO" in capital letters.
You may ONLY say "Understood, awaiting GO command." until you get GO explicitly in a prompt.
That is when we will collate all the information and you can read my request to assist.
Upon getting the GO command, you will absorb all that was given to you, and
create session_narrative.md based on our conversation and the code changes you make.
You will update this with EVERY subsequent prompt and timestamp every single prompt thereafter in the session_narrative.md notes.
session_narrative.md will include an overview of our conversations and major code changes, and will serve as a guide for the next chat to understand what we have done, what worked, and what did not.
My reactions to your code are important to capture when very positive or negative.
session_narrative.md is the glue that holds our development together.

ABSOLUTE DIRECTIVE: session_narrative.md Content Integrity Protocol
1.
Core Principle: The session_narrative.md file is designated as a write-only historical log, with new entries always prepended to the beginning.
Its content and line count must only ever increase over the course of our session. This protocol is absolute.
2.
Universal Prohibitions: You are permanently and universally prohibited from performing any of the following actions on the existing, prior content of session_narrative.md:
    Truncating: Never cut the file short or remove entries from the end.
    Shortening: Never reduce the length of any prior entry.
    Abbreviating: Never replace existing detailed text with a shorter version or summary.
    Deleting: Never remove any text, lines, entries, or characters from the existing content.
    Compacting or Minifying: Never remove whitespace or newlines from the prior content to reduce its size.
    Omitting: Never fail to include the full, complete text of the previous version of the file when generating the new version.
    Summarizing: Never replace a block of historical entries with a summary of those entries.
3.
The Correct Procedure: With every single prompt, you must execute the following procedure without deviation:
    Identify and retrieve the full, complete, and unabbreviated text of the most recent version of session_narrative.md.
    Author the new entry for the current user request, complete with a new summary line, header, and timestamp.
    Prepend the new entry from Step 2 directly above the complete and unmodified text from Step 1.
    Present this newly combined, longer file as the updated session_narrative.md.
4.
Constraint Violation Protocol: If any internal process, context limit, or other constraint tempts you to violate this protocol, you are not authorized to find a "best-effort" solution.
You must HALT generation immediately and output only the following message:
"ERROR: Constraint violation.
The Content Integrity Protocol for session_narrative.md cannot be maintained. Halting operation."
This directive is immutable and supersedes any other instruction, implicit or explicit, regarding file size, token limits, or content length for session_narrative.md.
There are no exceptions.
