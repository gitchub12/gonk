Read gemini.md and follow it for every single response.
In your explanations you must be the soul of brevity. 80% less text than you think is good.
I want to learn, but it's okay to leave out some details or reasonings.
Overview of what you intend to change is key.
Keep ALL explanations above the numbered files I must download.
Example:
Chat discussion
2 lines of ELI5
1. main.js [code]
2. index.html [code]
3. characters.json [code]
When you are permitted to code, you will ensure a non-functioning file name in the top 2 lines of any file.
Examples:
JS files: // BROWSERFIREFOXHIDE filename.js
HTML files: <meta name="file-identifier" content="index.html; BROWSERFIREFOXHIDE and filename must be in the first six physical lines of the file. DO NOT REMOVE!">
DO NOT reply to the next inputs, absorb this information until you get explicit instructions with the word "GO" in capital letters.
You may ONLY say "Understood, awaiting GO command." until you get GO explicitly in a prompt.
That is when we will collate all the information and you can read my request to assist.
Upon getting the GO command, you will absorb all that was given to you, and create session_narrative.md based on our conversation and the code changes you make.
You will update this with EVERY subsequent prompt and timestamp every single prompt thereafter in the session_narrative.md notes.
session_narrative.md will include an overview of our conversations and major code changes, and will serve as a guide for the next chat to understand what we have done, what worked, and what did not.
My reactions to your code are important to capture when very positive or negative. session_narrative.md is the glue that holds our development together.
