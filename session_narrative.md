### Post-Mortem: Vector Wall 3D Rendering Failures
This document serves as a detailed summary of all attempted solutions and their resulting failures for the vector wall 3D rendering feature. The goal is to draw a chain of connected walls, vertex-to-vertex, in the 2D editor and have them appear as correctly positioned, solid, textured walls in the 3D game. While the 2D editor functionality is perfect, the 3D implementation remains elusive.

**Current Unresolved Issue:** Walls drawn in the editor appear in the 3D world but are not in the correct location or orientation relative to their 2D representation.

### Chronology of Failed Attempts

#### Attempt 1: Midpoint Rotation
* **Method:** For each wall segment, a `BoxGeometry` was created. The mesh was positioned at the calculated midpoint between the start and end vertices and then rotated to align with the segment's angle.
* **Resulting Failure:** This caused a "starburst" or "asterisk" visual artifact. At any shared vertex, the connecting walls would not meet flush. Instead, they would overlap and radiate from the vertex because each wall was rotating around its own center point, leaving large gaps.

#### Attempt 2: Procedural Extrusion
* **Method:** To solve the connection problem, the `BoxGeometry` was abandoned. A new method was implemented to procedurally generate a precise mesh. It calculated the four 2D corner points of the wall's footprint and created a `THREE.Shape`. This shape was then extruded upward using `ExtrudeGeometry`.
* **Partial Success:** This method **successfully fixed the connection problem**. The rendered shapes were correctly triangular, and walls connected perfectly end-to-end.
* **Resulting Failures:** This approach introduced three new, critical bugs:
    1.  **Performance:** `ExtrudeGeometry` proved to be extremely computationally expensive, causing the game to become "very SLOW."
    2.  **Positioning:** A bug in the implementation placed the walls high up in the sky, near the ceiling level, not on the floor.
    3.  **Appearance:** The walls rendered as hollow, untextured "cookie cutters," likely due to issues with the procedurally generated faces, normals, or UV mapping.

#### Attempt 3: Corrected Pivot Translation
* **Method:** Based on the failures of the extrusion method, the logic was reverted to using the much more performant `BoxGeometry`. This attempt was designed to correctly solve the original "starburst" issue by programmatically shifting the geometry's pivot point to its starting edge before placement and rotation. This is the standard and most efficient technique for this task.
* **Logic:** The `BoxGeometry` was created, its internal pivot was shifted using `.translate()`, the mesh was positioned at the wall's starting vertex, its Y-position was set to rest on the floor, and it was rotated.
* **Resulting Failure:** This is the current state. While the performance and appearance issues are solved, the primary bug persists: the walls, though correctly shaped relative to each other, **are not being created in the correct location** as drawn in the editor.

### Unaddressed Feature Request
During the last session, a new UI request was made:
* The toolbox icons on the left side of the editor should be made significantly larger.
* Text labels (e.g., "Paint", "Fill", "Rotate") should be added above or below each icon, similar to the layer selection buttons.

### Recommendation for Next Session
The core unresolved issue is almost certainly a subtle coordinate system mismatch when passing wall data from the 2D editor to the 3D renderer. The math for the **shape** of the walls is now correct, but the **position** is wrong.

The next attempt should **not** change the rendering method from the current `BoxGeometry` with pivot translation, as it is the most performant and correct approach in principle. Instead, the focus should be entirely on debugging the `createWalls` function in `environment_and_physics.js`. A thorough, step-by-step analysis of the `item.points` data received from the editor and how it is transformed into world coordinates (`x`, `y`, `z`) is required. Log the incoming editor coordinates and the final 3D world coordinates for a single wall segment to identify the exact point of failure in the transformation pipeline.

### Historical Summary
- **Session N-1:** Summary: Reverted slow wall generation and fixed position and rendering bugs.
- **Session N-2:** Summary: Re-engineered vector wall 3D generation and added right-click cancellation.
- **Session N-3:** Summary: Re-applied fix to remove console error for missing cover.
