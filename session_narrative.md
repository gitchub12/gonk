### Current Session Notes
- Addressed two issues related to the vector wall tool's appearance and functionality.
- **3D Rendering Fix:** Corrected the angle calculation logic for vector walls in `environment_and_physics.js`. The arguments in the `atan2` function were swapped, causing incorrect rotation in the 3D view. This has been fixed to ensure walls connect between the correct vertices in-game.
- **Editor UI Tweak:** Modified the `drawHoverAndVectorUI` function in `editor.js`. The helper dots for placing vector walls are now rendered as single, highly transparent pixels and are confined strictly within the level's boundaries, decluttering the editor view.
