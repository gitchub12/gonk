The user provided a screenshot of the level editor, requesting several fixes and usability improvements. The requests included making grid lines more visible, renaming a layer for clarity, changing the default map size, making NPC icons smaller and repositioning them, and adding a "deadzone" to the wall-drawing tool to prevent errors.

- **`GonkLevelEditor.html`**: The layer name in the dropdown was changed from "Walls" to "Walls & Doors". The default values for the map width and height inputs were updated from 128 to 64.
- **`editor/editor.js`**:
    - Default `gridWidth` and `gridHeight` properties were changed to 64.
    - The grid line color was changed to a more visible white with 50% opacity.
    - The rendering logic for NPC icons was modified to draw them at 75% of the cell size, aligned to the bottom-center.
    - The `updateHoveredLine()` function was rewritten to implement a 5% deadzone at grid intersections, making wall placement more precise.

User reported a bug where NPC names like "bb8" were incorrectly shortened to "bb" in the editor's asset palette. The user also requested that text labels for entities on the canvas be positioned below the entity icon, not in the center.

- **`editor/editor.js` (`populateNpcPalette`):** Modified the logic that determines the base name for grouping NPC skins. Added an exception for names like `bb8` and `r2d2` to prevent them from being shortened by the regex that removes trailing numbers.
- **`editor/editor.js` (`render`):** Adjusted the Y-coordinate calculation for the entity label rendering logic. Labels are now drawn centered horizontally but positioned vertically below their respective grid cells, instead of in the center of them, improving visibility.

User identified two issues with the level editor's "Entities" tab: incorrect icon generation and visual layering
## Implementation: Added data-driven 'iconUV' property to each model definition to specify location of face for icon generation, added layering process showing levels in order

The user identified two issues with the level editor's "Entities" tab: incorrect icon generation for non-humanoid models (e.g., Iron Golem) and a lack of visual grouping in the asset palette.

## Previous Implementation (Timestamp: Friday, August 15, 2025 at 8:28:42 AM CDT)
- **`gonk_models.js`:** Added a data-driven `iconUV` property to each model definition to specify the exact location of the face for icon generation.
- **`GonkLevelEditor.html`:** Included the `gonk_models.js` script and added CSS for palette group headers.
- **`editor/editor.js`:** Updated the icon generator to use the new `iconUV` data. Reworked the NPC palette to display assets in visually distinct groups with headers.

## User Request
The user provided a screenshot and noted two new issues in the level editor:
1.  **Bug:** The logic for grouping NPC skins in the palette is incorrectly shortening names that end with a number, such as "bb8" being reduced to "Bb".
2.  **New Feature:** Entities placed on the 2D canvas need text labels displaying their name. These labels should only appear at high zoom levels and feature a semi-transparent background fitted to the text.

## Implementation Plan
- **`editor/editor.js`:**
    - **Palette Fix:** In `EditorUI.populateNpcPalette`, the regular expression for determining an asset's base name will be modified. I will add specific logic to correctly handle known cases like "bb8" and "r2d2", preventing them from being incorrectly shortened while still properly grouping other assets like "gungan1" and "gungan2".
    - **Canvas Labels:** In `LevelEditor.render`, I will add a new drawing routine that executes only when `this.zoom` is above a certain threshold (e.g., 1.5). This routine will iterate through all placed entities and, for each one, draw its name (`entity.key`) below its icon. The text will be rendered with a fitted, semi-transparent background. The font size will be scaled inversely with the zoom level to ensure the labels remain readable and consistently sized on screen.
