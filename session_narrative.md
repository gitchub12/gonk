After receiving the correct `index.html` file, the previously implemented custom HUD was completely removed. The user's existing, more advanced HUD (HTML and CSS) has been integrated into the main game. Game logic in `main.js` was updated to manage ammo state and control the new HUD elements for health and ammo, which is toggled with the 'H' key. This update bundles the new HUD with the previous bug fixes for NPC skin loading and player strafe controls, providing a complete, up-to-date set of all changed files.

- **`index.html`**: Rebuilt to use the user's desired HUD layout and script loader.
- **`main.js`**: Re-implemented game state for ammo and added logic to control the user's HUD elements.
- **`player_gear.js`**: Re-implemented ammo consumption for pamphlet attacks.
- **`asset_loaders.js`**: Preserved the fix for dynamic NPC skin loading.
- **`environment_and_physics.js`**: Preserved the fix for player strafe controls.
