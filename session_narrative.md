## Previous User Request (Timestamp: Friday, August 15, 2025 at 8:28:42 AM CDT)
The user identified two issues with the level editor's "Entities" tab: incorrect icon generation for non-humanoid models (e.g., Iron Golem) and a lack of visual grouping in the asset palette.

## Previous Implementation (Timestamp: Friday, August 15, 2025 at 8:28:42 AM CDT)
- **`gonk_models.js`:** Added a data-driven `iconUV` property to each model definition to specify the exact location of the face for icon generation.
- **`GonkLevelEditor.html`:** Included the `gonk_models.js` script and added CSS for palette group headers.
- **`editor/editor.js`:** Updated the icon generator to use the new `iconUV` data. Reworked the NPC palette to display assets in visually distinct groups with headers.

## User Request
The user provided a screenshot and noted two new issues in the level editor:
1.  **Bug:** The logic for grouping NPC skins in the palette is incorrectly shortening names that end with a number, such as "bb8" being reduced to "Bb".
2.  **New Feature:** Entities placed on the 2D canvas need text labels displaying their name. These labels should only appear at high zoom levels and feature a semi-transparent background fitted to the text.

## Implementation Plan
- **`editor/editor.js`:**
    - **Palette Fix:** In `EditorUI.populateNpcPalette`, the regular expression for determining an asset's base name will be modified. I will add specific logic to correctly handle known cases like "bb8" and "r2d2", preventing them from being incorrectly shortened while still properly grouping other assets like "gungan1" and "gungan2".
    - **Canvas Labels:** In `LevelEditor.render`, I will add a new drawing routine that executes only when `this.zoom` is above a certain threshold (e.g., 1.5). This routine will iterate through all placed entities and, for each one, draw its name (`entity.key`) below its icon. The text will be rendered with a fitted, semi-transparent background. The font size will be scaled inversely with the zoom level to ensure the labels remain readable and consistently sized on screen.
