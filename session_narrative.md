The user requested a major UI overhaul for the level editor, a new control scheme for layer selection, and a fix for a persistent bug.

- **UI Overhaul:**
  - The text-based layer selection dropdown was removed from the left panel.
  - A new, icon-based vertical toolbar for layer selection was added to the main canvas area. This toolbar is dynamically generated, using the first available texture from each layer's asset folder as the icon for its button.
  - The toolbox icons for paint, rotate, and spawn tools were updated to use specific image files provided by the user.

- **New Controls:**
  - Users can now cycle through the available layers by holding **Ctrl** and using the **mouse wheel**.

- **Bug Fixes:**
  - The persistent bug causing horizontal walls to be placed one segment to the left has been addressed. The `updateHoveredLine` function was completely rewritten to use a more robust detection method. It now calculates the absolute closest horizontal or vertical grid line to the cursor, rather than relying on which grid cell the cursor is in, which prevents floating-point and boundary condition errors.

- **File Changes:**
  - **`GonkLevelEditor.html`**: Rewritten to remove the old layer dropdown, add the container for the new icon-based layer toolbar, and update the toolbox buttons to use `<img>` tags.
  - **`editor.js`**: Rewritten to implement the dynamic creation and management of the new layer toolbar, add the `Ctrl+Scroll` layer switching logic, and replace the wall-hovering logic with the improved algorithm.

Summary: Fixed editor 404 error by making furniture loading data-driven.
Saturday, August 16, 2025 at 4:21:10 PM CDT
The user provided a console log showing a 404 "File not found" error when the level editor tried to access `/data/furniture/models/`.

- **Problem:** The editor had a hardcoded path to the furniture models directory, which was incorrect and did not match the user's file structure. This approach is brittle and violates the project's data-driven principles.
- **Solution:** Instead of simply correcting the hardcoded path, the asset discovery logic in `editor.js` was modified to be truly data-driven. It now fetches `/data/furniture.json`, reads the `_config.modelPath` from the manifest, and uses that path to discover the furniture model files. This ensures the editor and the game remain synchronized.

- **File Changes:**
  - **`editor.js`**: Updated the `EditorAssetManager.discoverAssets` method to implement the new data-driven loading logic for furniture models.

Summary: Updated editor's asset discovery to support new subdirectory structure.
Saturday, August 16, 2025 at 4:06:18 PM CDT
The user has reorganized all PNG texture assets from a single `data/pngs/` folder into type-specific subdirectories (e.g., `data/pngs/floor/`, `data/pngs/wall/`).

- **Task:** Update the level editor's asset loading logic to accommodate this new structure.

- **File Changes:**
  - **`editor.js`**: The `EditorAssetManager.discoverAssets` method was updated. Instead of listing one directory and filtering by filename, it now iterates through a list of expected layer types and fetches directory listings for each corresponding subdirectory (e.g., `/data/pngs/floor/`). Additionally, a hardcoded path for the default floor texture was updated in `EditorUI.populateDefaultTextureSettings`.

Summary: Added editor tools (rotate, erase, spawn), fixed walls, updated visuals.
Saturday, August 16, 2025 at 3:57:39 PM CDT
User requested a combination of features and bug fixes for the level editor.

- **New Features:**
  - A floating toolbox was added with tools for 'Rotate', 'Erase', and 'Spawn Point' placement.
  - The 'Dangler' layer was converted from a line-based layer to a tile-based one.
  - A 'Rotate' tool was added to rotate any tile-based entity (assets, NPCs, danglers, spawns) by 90-degree increments.
  - A 'Spawn Point' tool and corresponding 'Spawns' layer were created. This allows placing up to 9 numbered and rotatable start points, using a hologonk icon.
  - A dedicated 'Eraser' tool was added to the new toolbox, providing a more intuitive alternative to the right-click erase function.

- **Visual Updates:**
  - Floor and subfloor layers are now rendered 40% darker on the canvas to improve contrast for objects placed on top of them.
  - The 'Water' layer is now rendered with 30% transparency when it or any layer above it is active, allowing visibility of underlying layers.

- **Bug Fixes:**
  - The wall-hovering logic in `updateHoveredLine` was rewritten to be more explicit, fixing a bug where horizontal walls were being selected and placed incorrectly, especially near grid intersections.

- **File Changes:**
  - `GonkLevelEditor.html`: Rewritten to include the new floating toolbox UI and add the 'Spawns' layer to the dropdown.
  - `editor.js`: Rewritten to incorporate state management for the new tools, implement the rotation and spawn point systems, handle the new visual rendering effects, and fix the wall placement bug.

The user provided a screenshot of the level editor, requesting several fixes and usability improvements. The requests included making grid lines more visible, renaming a layer for clarity, changing the default map size, making NPC icons smaller and repositioning them, and adding a "deadzone" to the wall-drawing tool to prevent errors.

- **`GonkLevelEditor.html`**: The layer name in the dropdown was changed from "Walls" to "Walls & Doors". The default values for the map width and height inputs were updated from 128 to 64.
- **`editor/editor.js`**:
    - Default `gridWidth` and `gridHeight` properties were changed to 64.
    - The grid line color was changed to a more visible white with 50% opacity.
    - The rendering logic for NPC icons was modified to draw them at 75% of the cell size, aligned to the bottom-center.
    - The `updateHoveredLine()` function was rewritten to implement a 5% deadzone at grid intersections, making wall placement more precise.

User reported a bug where NPC names like "bb8" were incorrectly shortened to "bb" in the editor's asset palette. The user also requested that text labels for entities on the canvas be positioned below the entity icon, not in the center.

- **`editor/editor.js` (`populateNpcPalette`):** Modified the logic that determines the base name for grouping NPC skins. Added an exception for names like `bb8` and `r2d2` to prevent them from being shortened by the regex that removes trailing numbers.
- **`editor/editor.js` (`render`):** Adjusted the Y-coordinate calculation for the entity label rendering logic. Labels are now drawn centered horizontally but positioned vertically below their respective grid cells, instead of in the center of them, improving visibility.

## Previous User Request (Timestamp: Friday, August 15, 2025 at 8:28:42 AM CDT)
The user identified two issues with the level editor's "Entities" tab: incorrect icon generation for non-humanoid models (e.g., Iron Golem) and a lack of visual grouping in the asset palette.

## Previous Implementation (Timestamp: Friday, August 15, 2025 at 8:28:42 AM CDT)
- **`gonk_models.js`:** Added a data-driven `iconUV` property to each model definition to specify the exact location of the face for icon generation.
- **`GonkLevelEditor.html`:** Included the `gonk_models.js` script and added CSS for palette group headers.
- **`editor/editor.js`:** Updated the icon generator to use the new `iconUV` data. Reworked the NPC palette to display assets in visually distinct groups with headers.

**Timestamp:** Friday, August 15, 2025 at 9:51:14 AM CDT

## User Request
The user provided a screenshot and noted two new issues in the level editor:
1.  **Bug:** The logic for grouping NPC skins in the palette is incorrectly shortening names that end with a number, such as "bb8" being reduced to "Bb".
2.  **New Feature:** Entities placed on the 2D canvas need text labels displaying their name. These labels should only appear at high zoom levels and feature a semi-transparent background fitted to the text.

## Implementation Plan
- **`editor.js`:**
    - **Palette Fix:** In `EditorUI.populateNpcPalette`, the regular expression for determining an asset's base name will be modified. I will add specific logic to correctly handle known cases like "bb8" and "r2d2", preventing them from being shortened while still properly grouping other assets like "gungan1" and "gungan2".
    - **Canvas Labels:** In `LevelEditor.render`, I will add a new drawing routine that executes only when `this.zoom` is above a certain threshold (e.g., 1.5). This routine will iterate through all placed entities and, for each one, draw its name (`entity.key`) below its icon. The text will be rendered with a fitted, semi-transparent background. The font size will be scaled inversely with the zoom level to ensure the labels remain readable and consistently sized on screen.
