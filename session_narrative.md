This update addresses a series of bugs and new feature requests. A bug where item rotations from the editor were ignored in-game has been fixed. Mirrored tapestry textures were corrected by flipping their UV mapping. The audio system was rewritten to support non-positional sound effects, and sounds were added for opening doors. Player movement speed was reduced by 30%, and the HUD's animated icon was updated to support a larger number of frames.

- **`environment_and_physics.js`**: Fixed item rotation logic, corrected tapestry mirroring, and integrated audio calls for doors.
- **`audio_system.js`**: Rewritten to support loading and playing arbitrary sound effects.
- **`asset_loaders.js`**: Updated to load the new sound files.
- **`main.js`**: Adjusted player movement speed and updated HUD animation frame count.
- **`index.html`**: Made a minor CSS tweak to the HUD.

The user reported that character textures were sharp in a separate viewer but blurry in the main game. This was diagnosed as a texture filtering issue. The game's asset loader was using the default "Linear" filtering, causing blurriness, while the viewer used "Nearest Neighbor" for a sharp, pixelated look. The `asset_loaders.js` file has been updated to explicitly set the magnification and minification filters to `THREE.NearestFilter` for all loaded textures, ensuring a consistent, crisp visual style.

- **`asset_loaders.js`**: All texture loading functions now set `magFilter` and `minFilter` to `THREE.NearestFilter`.
