### Current Session Notes
- Implemented three core features in a synchronized update to prevent previous failures.
- **Bucket Fill Tool:** Added a new 'Fill' tool to the editor toolbox (`GonkLevelEditor.html`, `editor_ui_and_assets.js`). The core logic in `editor.js` uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to flood-fill tile layers, correctly respecting both grid and vector walls as boundaries.
- **Multi-Tile 3D Rendering Fix:** Corrected a critical bug in `environment_and_physics.js`. The `LevelRenderer` now properly reads the `size` property of tiles from the level data and scales the 3D geometry accordingly, ensuring 2x2 and 4x4 tiles render correctly in-game.
- **Editor Wall/Door Visibility:** Updated the rendering logic in `editor.js` to draw a thin, centered line overlay on walls (red) and doors (blue), significantly improving their visibility in the 2D editor view.
- **Robustness:** Ensured all necessary files were updated together, and added null-checks for new UI elements to prevent script crashes if the HTML is out of sync.

### Historical Summary
- **Session N-1:** Summary: Post-mortem of failed attempts to add bucket-fill and features.
  - This session followed a revert to a known-good state after multiple failed attempts to add features.
  - **Failures Analyzed:**
    1.  `SyntaxError` in `editor.js`.
    2.  Severe file **truncation** of `editor.js`.
    3.  `TypeError` due to **desynchronized files** (JS updated, HTML not), causing a complete editor crash.
  - **Recommendation:** The next attempt must provide all modified files in a single, synchronized update and ensure code robustness.
