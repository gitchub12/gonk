This document provides context for a new session, following a revert to a known-good state. The project is currently at a checkpoint where the vector-wall drawing tool in the level editor is functional. Several subsequent attempts to add new features failed, leading to the revert.

### Last Stable State:
- The level editor successfully supports both grid-aligned walls and freeform vector walls.
- The editor renders a dotted "ghost line" from the last placed vertex to the cursor.

### Desired Features (Objective of Failed Attempts):
1.  **Bucket Fill Tool:** A tool to flood-fill tile layers (e.g., floor, ceiling) within areas enclosed by walls.
2.  **Multi-Size Tile Rendering:** A fix to ensure that 2x2 and 4x4 tiles, which render correctly in the 2D editor, also render at the correct larger size in the 3D game engine.
3.  **Editor Wall Visibility:** A visual aid in the 2D editor where placed walls are marked with a thin red center line and doors with a blue line to improve clarity.

### Analysis of Failures:
The implementation of the above features failed across three consecutive attempts due to distinct critical errors. The next session must address these specific failure points:

1.  **Attempt 1 Failure (Syntax Error):** The initial implementation introduced a JavaScript `SyntaxError` (`await` used in a non-`async` function) in `editor.js`. This prevented the editor from loading at all.

2.  **Attempt 2 Failure (File Truncation):** The attempt to fix the `SyntaxError` resulted in a severely **truncated `editor.js` file**. This is a recurring, critical issue with the AI's code generation that must be monitored. The file was incomplete and unusable.

3.  **Attempt 3 Failure (Desynchronized Files & TypeError):** The final attempt provided a syntactically correct `editor.js`, but the editor still failed to load (blank screen, no UI). The root cause was a `TypeError` in `editor_ui_and_assets.js`. This script had been updated to require a new HTML element (the bucket-fill button), but the corresponding `GonkLevelEditor.html` file was not provided in the same response. The script crashed when it couldn't find the HTML element, halting all UI initialization.

### Recommendation for Next Session:
To successfully implement the desired features, the next attempt must:
-   Address all three feature requests simultaneously.
-   **Provide all modified files (`GonkLevelEditor.html`, `editor_ui_and_assets.js`, `editor.js`, `environment_and_physics.js`) together in a single, synchronized update.**
-   Ensure JavaScript is robust against missing HTML elements by including null-checks before adding event listeners.
-   Scrupulously check all provided code files for completeness to prevent truncation.
