The user reported several critical rendering bugs in both the editor and the game. The editor was drawing walls as white lines, the game was showing pink fallback textures due to loading errors, and layers were Z-fighting.

- **Editor Rendering (`editor.js`):** The `renderWallLayer` function was rewritten to draw a thin, textured rectangle for each wall segment instead of a simple colored line, restoring the correct visual representation in the editor.
- **Asset Loading (`asset_loaders.js`, `editor_ui_and_assets.js`):**
  - Corrected faulty paths in the editor's asset discovery logic to resolve 404 errors for the `cover` and `furniture` directories.
  - Comprehensively updated the `assetDefs` list in the main `AssetManager` to include all available door, wall, floor, and ceiling textures, fixing the "pink texture" issue for `door_2` and others.
- **Game Rendering (`environment_and_physics.js`):**
  - Implemented a vertical stacking order for all geometric layers. The `LevelRenderer` now places the subfloor, floor, water, and ceiling at distinct Y-coordinates, eliminating the Z-fighting on the floor and correctly positioning water just above the floor plane.

**Summary: Planned major file consolidation and two new core FPS concepts.**
(Full entry from the previous session's log, now serving as Tier 1 history for this new session.)
The user initiated a major refactoring to consolidate the numerous small script files into a leaner, more manageable project structure. A final plan was agreed upon to merge 21 files into a core of 10, with clearer naming conventions. Additionally, two foundational FPS gameplay concepts were proposed and discussed for future implementation.

- **File Consolidation Plan:**
  - `main.js` will absorb the core engine, game loop, input, and constants.
  - `script_loader.js` will be moved into an inline script in `index.html`.
  - Three new, clearly named files will be created: `environment_and_physics.js`, `player_gear.js`, and `audio_system.js` (reverting from the generic `game_systems.js`).
  - The `editor.js` file will be slimmed down by offloading its UI and asset management logic to a new `editor_ui_and_assets.js`.
  - `character_config.js` will be kept separate for clarity.

- **New Gameplay Concepts Proposed:**
  1.  **Interactive Hazards (Explosive Barrels):** Adding simple, physics-based objects that can be used strategically by the player.
  2.  **Enemy Infighting:** A system where enemies of the same faction who accidentally damage each other will become hostile to one another.

**Summary: Corrected room scaling, player physics, and editor playtest workflow.**
The user provided screenshots and logs indicating incorrect room scaling (too tall), improper camera height, excessive speed, broken interactions, and a failed editor-to-game workflow. A 404 error for a missing lava texture was also identified.

- **World Scale (`game_global_constants.js`):** The `WALL_HEIGHT` was changed from 2.5 to 1.0 to match the `gridSize`, ensuring all rooms now render as perfect cubes as intended.
- **Player Physics (`game_global_constants.js`):**
  - `PLAYER.HEIGHT` was reduced from 1.5 to 0.5 to fit the new room scale.
  - `MOVEMENT.SPEED` was halved to `0.04` to reduce the "soaring" speed.
- **Interaction (`input.js`, `player_physics_and_interactions.js`):** Implemented a spacebar interaction system. Pressing 'Space' now finds the nearest door within range and calls its `open()` method.
- **Editor Playtest Workflow (`editor.js`, `level_management_system.js`):**
  - The editor's "PLAY" button now serializes the current level data and saves it to the browser's `localStorage`.
  - The game's level loader now prioritizes loading from `localStorage`, ensuring the player tests the exact version of the map they were just editing.
- **Asset Loader (`raw_asset_loader.js`):** Removed the definition for the non-existent `floor_lava_1.png` to fix the 404 error. The rendering code to handle glowing lava remains, pending the user adding the actual asset.

**Summary: Fixed wall geometry gaps and locked vertical camera movement.**
The user reported misaligned level geometry and incorrect camera controls. The root cause was identified as incorrect coordinate calculations in the rendering system and unrestricted mouse look in the input handler.

- **Camera Control (`input.js`):** The `onMouseMove` function was rewritten to completely ignore vertical mouse movement (`movementY`). This locks the player's view to the horizontal plane, enforcing the classic "Doom-style" FPS control scheme as requested.

- **Rendering (`rendering_system.js`):** The geometry creation logic was rewritten to fix positioning errors.
  - Floor and ceiling tiles are now correctly centered within their grid squares instead of on grid intersections.
  - Wall positioning logic was corrected to place walls precisely on the edges between grid squares.
  - This resolves the "two walls" bug and ensures that floors, walls, and ceilings connect seamlessly without any visual gaps.

- **Result:** The game now controls correctly for a classic FPS, and the level geometry renders as a solid, cohesive environment.
---
**Summary: Fixed game initialization hang and implemented JSON level rendering.**
The user reported that the game was stuck on a black screen after all scripts had loaded. The console log indicated the `initGame` function was called but never completed.

- **Bug Fix:** The root cause was a fatal flaw in `raw_asset_loader.js`. An incorrectly implemented promise in the texture loading function would never resolve if a texture file was missing, causing the entire asynchronous `initGame` function to hang forever without an error. This has been corrected.

- **System Implementation:**
  - `raw_asset_loader.js`: Rewritten to include proper error handling and a comprehensive list of all necessary game textures (floors, walls, etc.) ported from the prototype.
  - `level_management_system.js`: The `loadLevel` function was fully implemented. It now fetches the level JSON file from the server, parses it, and passes the data to the renderer.
  - `rendering_system.js`: Fully implemented to take parsed level JSON and build the 3D scene, creating geometry for floors, ceilings, walls, and doors.

- **Result:** The game no longer hangs on initialization. The `level_1.json` file is now correctly loaded and rendered, fixing the black screen issue and making the level visible and playable.

**Summary: Refactored engine to match user's new file structure.**
The user provided a definitive list of current project files, revealing a flat structure without an `/engine/` folder. The previous plan was scrapped and a new integration was performed targeting this correct structure.

- **File Deletions:** Obsolete placeholder files (`main.js`, `script_loader.js`, `raw_asset_loader.js`, `audio_system.js`, `input.js`) were marked for deletion.
- **File Creation:** Six new, focused system files (`game_engine_core.js`, `main_game_loop.js`, `player_physics_and_interactions.js`, `level_management_system.js`, `rendering_system.js`, `weapons_player.js`) were created to house the ported logic cleanly.
- **File Modifications:** `index.html` was updated to use the new script loader, and `game_global_constants.js` was updated with physics and weapon parameters.
- **Outcome:** The project architecture now reflects the user's intended flat-file structure while incorporating the advanced features from the prototype. The total file count increased by only one.

**Summary: Integrated legacy movement, pamphlet throwing, and level transition features.**
Began a new session by integrating core gameplay mechanics from a deprecated prototype into the new engine, as requested by the user.

- **Movement & Physics:** The physics system from the old prototype has been ported. The `player_physics_and_interactions.js` file was rewritten to use the old version's more dynamic movement logic, including acceleration, friction, and view-bobbing. The collision detection within this system was adapted to work with the new JSON-based level entities instead of the old procedural generation.

- **Pamphlet Projectiles:** A system for throwing pamphlets has been implemented.
  - A new file, `weapons_player.js`, was created to house the `Projectile` class and player-weapon logic, keeping it separate from the main loop.
  - The `input.js` file now maps the right mouse button to a new `handlePamphletAttack` function.
  - The `main_game_loop.js` now contains the logic to create and update these projectiles each frame.

- **Level Transitions:** The concept of using special doors to transition between levels has been added. The `LevelTransition` class from the old prototype was integrated into the new `level_management_system.js`, allowing doors in the level JSON to be flagged as level exits.

- **Configuration:** The `game_global_constants.js` file was updated with values from the old project to support the new physics and weapon parameters.
